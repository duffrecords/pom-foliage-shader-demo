# Parallax Occlusion Mapping Foliage Shader Demo

This is an experiment in Godot using parallax occlusion mapping (POM) to create the illusion of layers of foliage on a single mesh and (hopefully) render it more efficiently on a mobile platform. Leaves are often 3D modeled as a bunch of quads with a transparent texture but the overlapping transparency incurs additional draw calls and kills performance on mobile devices. What I'm doing here is drawing three layers of an ivy texture with alpha transparency over an opaque base texture of dead leaves and offsetting the apparent position of the lower layers as they would appear to the camera if they were actually discrete meshes positioned deeper than the surface. Each sub-layer can also be darkened to give the appearance of shadowing. The goal is to draw cheap undergrowth on a terrain mesh that could potentially span a very large area without it having that flat wallpaper look you'd get with a simple texture. For that reason, I'm using `render_mode unshaded` so the true shape of the mesh isn't revealed by light reflecting off it at a shallow angle. It doesn't look great on uneven terrain but, if you use it with a mostly flat or convex mesh with some larger, leafy assets scattered on top to draw the user's attention away, then maybe no one will notice.
